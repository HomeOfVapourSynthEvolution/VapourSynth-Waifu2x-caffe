Description
===========

waifu2x filter for VapourSynth, based on [waifu2x-caffe](https://github.com/lltcggie/waifu2x-caffe).


Note
====

The folder `models` must be located in the same folder as `Waifu2x-caffe.dll`.

Requires `cudnn64_7.dll` (cuDNN v7.4.1) to be in the search path. Due to the license of cuDNN, I can't distribute the required dll file. You have to register and download yourself at https://developer.nvidia.com/cudnn.


Usage
=====

    caffe.Waifu2x(clip clip[, int noise=0, int scale=2, int block_w=128, int block_h=block_w, int model=6, bint cudnn=True, int processor=0, bint tta=False, int batch=1])

* clip: Clip to process. Only planar format with float sample type of 32 bit depth is supported.

* noise: Noise reduction level.
  * -1 = none
  * 0 = low
  * 1 = medium
  * 2 = high
  * 3 = highest

* scale: Upscaling factor. Must be a power of 2. Set to 1 for no upscaling.

* block_w: The horizontal block size for dividing the image during processing. Smaller value results in lower VRAM usage, while larger value may not necessarily give faster speed. The optimal value may vary according to different graphics card and image size.

* block_h: The same as `block_w` but for vertical.

* model: Sets which model to use. Only `anime_style_art` is Y model (luma only), the others are RGB models.
  * 0 = anime_style_art (for 2D artwork)
  * 1 = anime_style_art_rgb (for 2D artwork)
  * 2 = photo (for photo and anime)
  * 3 = upconv_7_anime_style_art_rgb (has faster speed than `anime_style_art_rgb`, with equal or better quality)
  * 4 = upconv_7_photo (has faster speed than `photo`, with equal or better quality)
  * 5 = upresnet10 (has better quality than `upconv_7_anime_style_art_rgb`). Note that the result will change if the block size is different. The recommended block size of upresnet10 is 38. Use a larger `batch` size to compensate the slowness due to small block size.
  * 6 = cunet (has the best quality for 2D artwork among the bundled models). Note that the result will change if the block size is different. The block size of cunet must be divisible by 4.

* cudnn: When set to true, it uses cuDNN for processing. When set to false, CUDA will be used instead.

* processor: Sets which GPU device to use. The device number begins with 0. The default device will be selected if a nonexistent device is specified.

* tta: Whether to use TTA(Test-Time Augmentation) mode. It increases PSNR by 0.15 or so, but 8 times slower.

* batch: The batch size for concurrent processing of blocks.


Compilation
===========

Requires [customized Caffe library](https://github.com/HolyWu/caffe). To build `Caffe`, you must have all the dependencies: `CUDA Toolkit 10`, `cuDNN 7`, `OpenBLAS`, `Boost`, `protobuf`, `glog`, and `gflags`. Additionally, `waifu2x-caffe` library requires `OpenCV 3`. The defaults in `Makefile.config` should work, but adjust the relevant lines if not (such as `CUDA_DIR`). Then just type `make all -j4` to compile `Caffe`.

There are options `cuda_includedir` and `cuda_libdir` settable in Meson. The defaults are `/usr/local/cuda/include` and `/usr/local/cuda/lib64` respectively.
```
meson build
ninja -C build
```
